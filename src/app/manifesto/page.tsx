              <p>
                For the past year, I have worked closely with ecommerce founders
                and operators on real stores across the path from finding, to
                choosing, to buying, and the systems teams use to understand
                each part.
              </p>
              <p>
                The repeated problem was not a lack of dashboards. It was the
                weak link between what a shopper did, what may have caused it,
                what the team changed, and what happened next.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before Beseam, I worked on measurement, reliability, and
                large-scale data systems at Google and Amazon. The scale is
                different, but the discipline is the same. A system can look
                healthy in one view while the customer is already encountering
                failure somewhere else.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is why I am building Beseam: to keep observing,
                understanding, acting, and learning in one continuous loop, with
                the evidence behind each step still attached.

                A product can lose ground before the visit, in onsite search, on
                the product page, at checkout, or after a change that never gets
                measured. The practical response is to connect the evidence that
                matters to the same commercial question and act on what the
                merchant can actually control.
